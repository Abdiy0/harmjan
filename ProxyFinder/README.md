# ProxyFinder
This is a program to calculate LD proxies for a set of of input SNPs. It provides possibilities to search for proxies, given arbitrary genomic distances, LD and MAF cutoffs, but also allows for pairwise calculations. It uses Tabix to quickly grep SNPs out of large reference dataset VCFs (such as 1000 genomes).
